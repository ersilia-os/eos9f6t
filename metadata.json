    "Description": "This model was developed to support the early efforts in the identification of novel drugs against SARS-CoV2. It predicts the probability that a small molecule inhibits SARS-3CLpro-mediated peptide cleavage. It was developed using a high-throughput screening against the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV1, as no data was yet available for the new virus (SARS-CoV2) causing the COVID-19 pandemic. It uses the ChemProp model.",
